This file is a summary of the switches used in the en_US_improved affix file.
A description of the affix file format is included.

In addition to the new suffix and prefix rules, a modified TRY list is
used in order to properly find spelling errors in words having . (period)
' (apostrophe) and - (hyphen) within them. A replacement list for common
mis-spellings has also been incorporated.

The en_US_improved.aff affix file is a heavily modified version of
en_GB.aff created by David Bartlett and Andrew Brown.

# What follows is cut and pasted from the instructions at
# http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/affix.readme

The first line has 4 fields:

Field
-----
1     SFX   - indicates this is a suffix
2     D     - is the name of the character which represents this suffix
3     verb  - part of speech formed by applying this affix
4     Uc    - list of affixes to apply after this one (replaced the previous Y/N cross product field for prefixes)
5     4     - indicates that sequence of 4 affix entries are needed to
              properly store the affix information

The remaining lines describe the unique information for the 4 affix
entries that make up this affix.  Each line can be interpreted
as follows: (note fields 1 and 2 are used as a check against line 1 info)

Field
-----
1     SFX         - indicates this is a suffix
2     D           - is the name of the character which represents this affix
3     y           - the string of chars to strip off before adding affix
                         (a 0 here indicates the NULL string)
4     ied         - the string of affix characters to add
                         (a 0 here indicates the NULL string)
5     [^aeiou]y   - the conditions which must be met before the affix
                    can be applied

Field 5 is interesting.  Since this is a suffix, field 5 tells us that
there are 2 conditions that must be met.  The first condition is that
the next to the last character in the word must *NOT* be any of the
following "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u".  The second condition is that
the last character of the word must end in "y".
